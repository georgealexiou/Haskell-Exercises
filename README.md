# Haskell-Exercises

This repository includes code from my Programming 3 Module at the University of Southampton. This includes code from both Coursework 1 and 2 of this module.

Coursework 1 (Labs.hs) was a collection of basic exercises done in haskell including list comprehension, tree search, custom data structures, stack-based machines, reducers and evaluators

Cpursework 2 (Challenges.hs, Parsing.hs, Tests.hs) was a collection of more advanced haskell challenges that revolved around the concept of Lambda Calculus and Lambda Expressions. For this coursework we needed to write different haskell functions to perform alpha and beta reduction, parsing lambda expressions, parsing let expressions, pretty printing lambda expressions and conversion of lambda expressions to let expressions and vice versa.
